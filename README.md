I'm currently immersed in the world of software development, with a primary focus on using JavaScript libraries for web, Android, and iOS development. My toolkit includes React Native and Expo for creating cross-platform mobile apps, while I turn to NestJS for building robust backend applications. When it comes to databases, I've found my preference in SurrealDB.

Over the years, I've also dabbled in various other technologies, honing my skills in:

PHP, particularly with CodeIgniter (CI)
Golang, often paired with GORM
R-GeneOntology
Java, with a specialization in Spring 5 and Spring Boot
Proficiency in SCSS, HTML, and jQuery
Crafting modules for Apache using the C language
This diverse skill set equips me to tackle a wide range of software development projects and challenges with confidence and expertise.

I also possess hands-on experience with Ubuntu, Docker, and implementing CI/CD practices for server management. Additionally, I've honed my skills in the realm of DevOps, further enhancing my proficiency in managing and optimizing development and deployment processes.
